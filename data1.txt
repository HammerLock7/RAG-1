therefore the number of users per day was expected to be ﬁve times
higher than the patient and staff population.
    Waste composition and production for PIH were estimated us-
ing a per capita daily waste production of 1.2 L of urine and 520 g
(wet weight) of fecal matter based on Polprasert [24], which
accounted for dietary and cultural factors affecting human waste in
the developing world. The density and moisture content of fecal
matter was estimated to be 1.4 g/cm3 and 83%, respectively [25].
The daily waste production rate per capita was divided into ﬁve
latrine uses per day, consisting of three urinations and two defe-
cations, in order to determine wastewater content on a ‘per use’
basis.
    Daily wastewater production was estimated for several waste
conveyance strategies: (1) digestion of latrine waste in-vessel with
no conveyance water; (2) bucket ﬂush (0.5 L of conveyance water);
(3) low ﬂush toilets (4 L of conveyance water); and (4) low ﬂush
toilets (4 L) with urinal waste diverted from the AD system. The AD
system size was calculated for each wastewater scenario using a 47-
day retention time, and potential CH4 production was calculated
using values derived from the BMP testing.
